# Welcome to Machine Learning!

This is summary of Machine Learning course. I am actually not a quit professional IT student but a student majoring in Mechatronics and never get in touch with machine learning before. Therefore, this is the first course I have studied regarding machine learning. Suggested by many people in “zhihu”, the course delivered by Andrew Ng, is pretty comfortable and acceptable for machine learning beginner. Therefore, through several months, I have gone through all the content in this course, and I plan to summary some points and ideas delivered in this course for better understanding machine learning. Also, there is a course name statistical machine learning in this year, I will try to combine these two courses to illuminate what I understand the ideas of machine learning.

## Summary
Generally speaking, machine learning can be divided into two aspects, supervised and unsupervised learning. The term “supervised learning” is that we feed the training algorithm with given data sets that have label. In the contrast, the term “unsupervised learning” is that we feed the training algorithm with given data sets that have no label.
Here are some of the most important supervised learning algorithms:

       K-Nearest Neighbors 
       Linear Regression
       Logistic Regression
       Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
       Decision Trees and Random Forests
       Neural Network

Here are some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms:

       Clustering:
          K-means
          Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)
          Expectation maximization
       Visualization and dimensionality reduction:
          Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
          Kernel PCA
          Locally-linear Embedding (LLE)
          t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding 
       Association rule learning
    
In this summary, due to the machine learning course content that concerning the limited topics, I only focus on the highlighting topics above.
